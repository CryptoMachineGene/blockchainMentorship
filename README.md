This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through a structured blockchain developer mentorship, focused on building, testing, and deploying smart contracts using **Solidity**, **JavaScript**, and **Hardhat**.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project tracks my milestone-based learning through a blockchain developer mentorship program. It follows a step-by-step approach to creating, testing, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts.

Each commit reflects a core topic or task, serving as both a development journal and a modular smart contract reference for future use.

---

## 🔨 Tech Stack

- **Solidity** – Smart contract development  
- **Hardhat** – Ethereum development environment  
- **JavaScript** – Scripting and test logic  
- **HTML/CSS** – Frontend scaffolding (minimal)

---

## 📌 Commit Milestones

- **Create Project**  
  Initialized the Hardhat project with core folder structure (`/contracts`, `/scripts`, `/test`, `/src`, `/public`). Installed dependencies.

- *(Skipped in commit history)*

- **Testing Contracts**  
  Created private/public key pairs. Wrote and ran smart contract tests using Hardhat’s testing suite (Mocha/Chai).

- **4–6**  
  *(Reserved or unlabeled milestones)*

- **Token Transfer Delegation**  
  Implemented logic for delegated token transfers (e.g., `approve()` and `transferFrom()` pattern).

- **Token Deployment**  
  Finalized deployment script and deployed an ERC-20 token contract to a testnet. Created `TokenFlatten.sol` for verification.

---

## 📁 Repo Structure

- `/contracts` – Solidity smart contracts (token logic, delegation)  
- `/scripts` – Deployment and interaction scripts  
- `/test` – JavaScript-based unit tests  
- `/src`, `/public` – Basic frontend structure  
- `TokenFlatten.sol` – Flattened contract for verification/auditing

---

## 🧪 Topics Covered

- ERC-20 Token Creation  
- Token Transfer & Allowance Logic  
- Delegated Transfer Authorization  
- Private/Public Key Management  
- Smart Contract Testing (Mocha/Chai)  
- Hardhat Deployment Workflow

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

This repo will continue to evolve as I explore more advanced topics, including:

- Contract inheritance & abstraction  
- Event logging  
- Upgradable smart contracts  
- Security best practices & audits
