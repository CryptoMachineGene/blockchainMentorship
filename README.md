# blockchainMentorship

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through a structured blockchain developer mentorship, 
focused on building, testing, and deploying smart contracts using **Solidity**, **JavaScript**, and **Hardhat**.

## 🧠 Overview

Each commit reflects a new milestone in the mentorship progression, from project initialization and contract writing to unit testing and delegation logic. 
The project is designed to help me master foundational Web3 concepts while developing production-relevant dApp building skills.

### 🔨 Stack
- **Solidity** (smart contract language)
- **Hardhat** (Ethereum dev environment)
- **JavaScript** (for scripts and testing)
- **HTML/CSS** (frontend stubs)

---

## 📁 Repo Structure

- `/contracts`: Solidity smart contracts (tokens, delegation logic, etc.)
- `/scripts`: Deployment and execution scripts for Hardhat
- `/test`: Unit tests for smart contracts
- `/src`, `/public`: Basic frontend scaffolding
- `TokenFlatten.sol`: Flattened version of the deployed contract for verification or audit purposes

---

## 🧪 Topics Covered

- ERC-20 Token Creation
- Token Transfer & Allowance
- Delegated Transfer Logic
- Contract Deployment with Hardhat
- Private/Public Key Management (for testnets)
- Smart Contract Testing with Mocha/Chai

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

This repo will continue to evolve as I move through more advanced topics, including:
- Contract inheritance
- Events & logging
- Upgradable contracts
- Security best practices
